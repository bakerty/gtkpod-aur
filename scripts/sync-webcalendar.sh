# sync ipod with webcalendar

# Usage:
#
# sync-webcalendar.sh [-i <ipod mountpoint>] [-d <webcalendar uri>] [-c <calendar name>]
#
# with the following defaults:

# mount point of ipod
IPOD_MOUNT='/media/ipod'
# uri for webcalendar (example)
DATAFILE='https://somewhere.local/calendar.ics'
# calendar name
CALENDAR='webcalendar'
# special options for wget
WGET_OPTIONS='--no-check-certificate'

# About the encoding used by the iPod (by Jorg Schuler):
#
# For some reason the encoding used for the contact files and
# calenader files depends on the language you have set your iPod
# to. If you set your iPod to German, iso-8859-15 (or -1?) is
# expected. If you set it to Japanese, SHIFT-JIS is expected. You need
# to reboot the iPod to have the change take effect, however. (I'm
# using firmware version 1.3.)
#
# If you know of more encodings, please let me know, so they can be
# added here:
#
# iPod language      encoding expected
# ----------------------------------------
# German             ISO-8859-15
# Japanese           SHIFT-JIS
