# Script to sync the ipod with abook

# Usage:
# 
# sync-abook.sh [-i <ipod mountpoint>] [-d <abook database>]
#           ... [-e <encoding ipod>] [-f <encoding abook>]
#
# with the following defaults: 

IPOD_MOUNT='/media/ipod'				# mount point of ipod
DATAFILE='~/.abook/addressbook'	                # the abook db
ENCODING_FROM=UTF-8                             # encoding used by abook
ENCODING=ISO-8859-15                            # encoding used by ipod

# Unless called with "-e=none" this script requires "iconv" available
# from http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/

# About the encoding used by the iPod (by Jorg Schuler):
#
# For some reason the encoding used for the contact files and
# calenader files depends on the language you have set your iPod
# to. If you set your iPod to German, iso-8859-15 (or -1?) is
# expected. If you set it to Japanese, SHIFT-JIS is expected. You need
# to reboot the iPod to have the change take effect, however. (I'm
# using firmware version 1.3.)
#
# If you know of more encodings, please let me know, so they can be
# added here:
#
# iPod language      encoding expected
# ----------------------------------------
# German             ISO-8859-15
# Japanese           SHIFT-JIS
