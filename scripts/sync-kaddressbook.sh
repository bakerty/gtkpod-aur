# Script for syncing kaddressbook data with iPod

# Usage:
# 
# sync-kaddressbook.sh [-i <ipod mountpoint>] [-d <kaddressbook data file>]
#           ...        [-e <encoding>]
#
# with the following defaults: 

IPOD_MOUNT=/media/ipod                          # mountpoint of ipod
DATAFILE=~/.kde/share/apps/kabc/std.vcf       # vcard file
ENCODING=ISO-8859-15                          # encoding used by ipod

# Unless called with "-e none" this script requires "iconv" available
# from http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/

# About the encoding used by the iPod (by Jorg Schuler):
#
# For some reason the encoding used for the contact files and
# calenader files depends on the language you have set your iPod
# to. If you set your iPod to German, iso-8859-15 (or -1?) is
# expected. If you set it to Japanese, SHIFT-JIS is expected. You need
# to reboot the iPod to have the change take effect, however. (I'm
# using firmware version 1.3.)
#
# If you know of more encodings, please let me know, so they can be
# added here:
#
# iPod language      encoding expected
# ----------------------------------------
# German             ISO-8859-15
# Japanese           SHIFT-JIS


# Changelog:
#
# 2004/06/27 (Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users dot sourceforge dot net>):
# Changed to accept ipod-mountpath and encoding as command line
# option
#
# Split into two files -- one for contacts, one for calendar.
#
# Placed under GPL in agreement with Markus Gaugusch.
#
# Added note about encoding used by the iPod.
#
# 2004/07/02 (Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users dot sourceforge dot net>):
# Added Usage-line, added check for vcard file, rearranged source
#
# 2004/07/03 (Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users dot sourceforge dot net>):
# Made "iconv" optional (call with "-e none")
#
# Removed "dos2unix" as my iPod (firmware 1.3) happily accepted
# DOS-type vcards as well. Instead changed the "grep" pattern to
# catch \cr\lf as well.


# overwrite default settings with optional command line arguments
